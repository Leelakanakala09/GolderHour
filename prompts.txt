PROMPTS USED DURING DEVELOPMENT

1. "Road accident with visible bleeding"
   → Expected severity: SEVERE

2. "Person unconscious after fall"
   → Expected severity: SEVERE

3. "Minor burn injury on hand"
   → Expected severity: URGENT

4. "Multiple trauma symptoms selected together"
   → System escalates to SEVERE

5. "Custom user-entered emergency description"
   → System maps input to closest known trauma category

-----------------------------------

DESIGN NOTES

- Structured prompts were designed to reduce ambiguity during panic
- Severity escalation follows conservative safety-first principles
- The system prioritizes reducing response time over detailed explanations

-----------------------------------

FUTURE PROMPT EXTENSIONS

- LLM-based free-text understanding
- Voice-to-text emergency descriptions
- Multilingual emergency prompts
